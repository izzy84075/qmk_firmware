# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware - chrislewisdev fork

## Typing Speed -> RGB Animation Control

This fork of qmk_firmware contains the code I whipped up to make your keyboard's RGB animation speed match your typing speed. As of writing, this is a "first draft" version, aka the simplest implementation I could think of with the quickest/hackiest code. Beware hard-coding :)

Regardless, I'm happy to share the code and discuss improvements with anyone who'd like to contribute. I'll do my best to facilitate it in my spare time.

## Getting Started

My original change amounts to several lines in `quantum.h`, `quantum.c` and `rgblight.c`. To see the details it's probably easiest if you look at [this commit](https://github.com/chrislewisdev/qmk_firmware/commit/2d3fbc5d0ad70309ede5cdeb9cf84380fd69baae) which contains all the changes.

I've created GitHub Issues for the most pressing things that need to be addressed before this could be merged into QMK - if you're interested in helping out, please do take a look!

To test it, I've just been using my DZ60 keyboard, building the firmware with `make dz60:default` and flashing with qmk_toolbox. If you're not familiar with how to do that, it's probably best you consult the [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/).

Below is the original QMK readme:

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](https://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](http://www.ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the [Clueboard product line](http://clueboard.co/).

## Documentation

* [See the official documentation on docs.qmk.fm](https://docs.qmk.fm)

The docs are hosted on [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/qmk/firmware/details) and [GitHub](/docs/) (they are synced). You can request changes by making a fork and [pull request](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pulls), or by clicking the "suggest an edit" link on any page of the docs.

## Supported Keyboards

* [Planck](/keyboards/planck/)
